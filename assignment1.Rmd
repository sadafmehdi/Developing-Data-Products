## Introduction
The goal of this assignment is to create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.
I have pinned a few palaces to visit in india.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown


```{r Leaflet }
library(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lng= 78.042068,lat=27.173891, popup = "Taj Mahal, Agra") %>%
  addMarkers(lng=78.4662 ,lat=17.3313,popup = "Falaknuma Palace, Hyderabad")%>%
  addMarkers(lng= 73.6835,lat=24.5764,popup = "City Palace, Udaipur")

my_map
```
